<p>The flight into Egypt I have assumed to have occurred about sixteen
months after the birth of Jesus. Guided by Christian tradition, and
holding the birth of our Lord to have taken place in December, it
follows that the period which I have assigned to the Flight into Egypt
is the second April in His life.</p>

<p>During the spring-time, rich in flowers and first-fruits, the <span class="smcap">Holy
Travellers</span> are represented as passing across the Philistine plain on
the road to Gaza at a distance of about thirty miles from their point
of departure. The night is far spent. While the declining moon sheds
its last rays on the natural objects in the picture, unearthly light reveals
the embodied spirits of the martyred Innocents advancing in procession.</p>

<p>The Virgin is seated on a she-ass of the breed now known as the
Mecca race, and the foal follows its mother, as is seen to this day in
the East. Signal fires—still lit in Syria in time of trouble—are burning
on the slope looking down from the tableland. St. Joseph is watching
these fires intent on discovering any signs that may present themselves of
a movement of soldiery upon the road. Of the trees that enrich the
landscape, the nearest ones shelter a water-wheel used for the irrigation of
the land. The more remote group clusters round a village, with its few
huts visible by the lights that burn within. Having left the colder climate
of the high country, then thickly populated and well cultivated, the
fugitives have descended into the rich and more balmy atmosphere of the
plain. As they advance nearer and nearer to a place of safety they feel
the blessed relief of a sense of peace after disturbance and terror.</p>

<p>Conscious of the divine mercy, the heart of Mary rejoicing over
her rescued son, feels compassion for the murdered Innocents, and for
the childless mothers less happy and less honoured than herself. It is
at this moment when the Virgin has been replacing the garments in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_4"></a>[4]</span>
which the infant had been hurriedly wrapped at the time of the escape
from Bethlehem, that Jesus recognises the spirits of the slain Innocents,
His little neighbours of Bethlehem, children like Himself. They reveal
the signs of their martyrdom. Garlanded for the sacrifice, bearing branches
and blossoms of trees, they progressively mark their understanding of the
glory of their service. An infant spirit isolated in wonder finds no mark
of harm, where the sword wounded him, permitted to appear on his
glorified body. Behind in the air are the babes as yet hardly awakened
to the new life. In differing revelations of sorrow they show the influence
of earthly terror and suffering still impressed upon them. Towards the
front are other spirits of children triumphing in completer knowledge of
their service. One of them in priestly office leads the band. Those who
follow cast down their tokens of martyrdom in the path of their recognised
Lord. Others encircle the travel-worn foal, wearily following its mother,
and so bring it up to the onward group. The shallow stream over which
the procession passes, reflecting the quiet beauty of the night sky, is
unruffled except by the steps of Joseph. The flood upon which the
spiritual children advance forms a contrast to this, by being in motion.
The living fountains of water—the streams of eternal life—furnish this,
mystically portrayed as ever rolling onward. Instead of being dissipated
in natural vapour, the play of its wavelets takes the form of airy globes
which image the Jewish belief in the millennium that is to follow the
advent of the Messiah.</p>

<p>“Behold, the angel of the Lord appeareth to Joseph in a dream, saying, Arise, and take
the young child and his mother, and flee into Egypt, and be thou there until I bring thee
word: for Herod will seek the young child to destroy him. When he arose, he took the
young child and his mother by night, and departed into Egypt: and was there until the death
of Herod: that it might be fulfilled which was spoken of the Lord by the prophet, saying,
Out of Egypt have I called my son. Then Herod, when he saw that he was mocked of the
wise men, was exceeding wroth, and sent forth, and slew all the children that were in
Bethlehem, and in all the coasts thereof, from two years old and under, according to the time
which he had diligently inquired of the wise men. Then was fulfilled that which was spoken
by Jeremy the prophet, saying, In Rama was there a voice heard, lamentation, and weeping,
and great mourning, Rachel weeping for her children, and would not be comforted, because
they are not.”</p>
</div>


<p>The Flight into Egypt is generally believed in the West to have
occurred a few days after the birth of our Lord. The Eastern Churches
on the other hand extend the interval which is supposed to have elapsed
to a period of nearly two years.</p>

<p>The considerations which influenced the choice of age for the Saviour
in the picture are therefore not simply artistic. The view of the Eastern
Churches can scarcely be rejected with reasonable regard to the circumstances
of the visit of the Magi, and of the terms of Herod’s fiat
for the murder of the male children of two years old and under,
“according to the time which he had diligently inquired of the wise men.”
In the Gospel of St. Luke, however, it is said that after the Purification in
the Temple, which was forty days after the birth, St. Joseph and the Holy
Virgin returned to Nazareth with the Child, and that there, speaking in
general terms after the accomplished fact, Jesus grew up. An apparent
discrepancy is thus pointed out by some critics, but it is one such as often
presents itself in all honest evidence of facts; and the report in St. Matthew
simply requires it to be understood that the Holy Family came back
again to Bethlehem from Nazareth. Indeed, the residence in the latter
city does not seem to have been chosen as a permanent one, for, on the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6"></a>[6]</span>
return from Egypt, it was only accepted because safety was still not
so certain in the dominion of Archelaus. The motive which had
operated in bringing St. Joseph and the Virgin to Bethlehem from the
north, before the birth of our Lord, is generally understood to be the
securing of claim, under the enrolment of Quirinius, to the genealogy,
and perhaps to some share of family inheritance. This would operate
more powerfully after the birth of Jesus in influencing the parents to
make the city of David their permanent home. There is therefore no
contradiction between the two Gospels, but the comparison of the
evidence given by the two Evangelists in my mind strongly establishes
the view of the Eastern Churches, that the Saviour’s birth took place
more than one year earlier than the flight. Herod’s estimate of the age
of Him who was born King of the Jews was not made without careful
calculation of the date from the birth, so as fully to include the Child
whom he had determined to destroy, that he might thus, like the typical
politician of the great reader of human nature,</p>

<p class="noic">“Circumvent God,”</p>

<p class="noi">and it follows accordingly that Jesus was not fully two years of age.</p>

<p>Whatever reserve of feeling there may be towards a reading which
conveys a disputable view of a fact in Holy Writ, let it be remembered
that an artist treating a subject in which such is offered cannot delay to
make his choice. The first part of his study in making his design is to
form a theory in harmony with the intention of the records illustrated, as
read by the fullest light, and to leave an exploded theory with confidence
that his rendering will be approved as either correct or unobjectionable.
In this case no special pleading is needed, seeing that St. Augustine
puts the Massacre of the Innocents in connection with the Passover.
Perhaps he regarded it as an antithesis to the slaying of the first-born
in Egypt, and understood the quotation by St. Matthew from
Hosea, “Out of Egypt have I called my son,” as having a fuller purpose
than at first appears. In any case he regarded the festival as not fixing
the date of the massacre, and the fact argues that neither the date given
in the Western Church for the commemoration, nor in the Greek Church,
is understood as the date of the sacrifice of the first Christian Martyrs.</p>

<p>The journey has been across the mountains from Bethlehem towards
Gaza. The birth-place of Christ is on the further side of the range, about
five miles beyond the highest elevation, somewhat to the right of the point<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7"></a>[7]</span>
where the star is rising above the distant curve of the hill; the nearer
mountains are about 1,500 feet in height. These, with intervening
valleys, are further on in the highlands overtopped by rolling waves of
the limestone rocks until they reach the watershed of the country, which
is about 2,400 feet in height. Bethlehem lies beyond this 500 feet lower,
on a spur overlooking the eastern country, thus falling gradually to the
plain of the Dead Sea.</p>

<p>The ass is of the Mecca race—so called from the fact that they are
brought from the Arab city of pilgrimage as descendants from one which
Mohammed rode. They were necessarily always costly, being much
sought for on account of their power of endurance, and their surefootedness.
It is quite within licence to assume that St. Joseph may have
provided himself with such an animal for his journeys. The route taken
has been by bye-paths across the mountains and fields to the plain with
beaten tracks from all other cities to Gaza, which, once passed, will put the
fugitives in safety.</p>

<p>In eluding Herod’s cruel decree, St. Joseph would have made his
route as far from the state highway as possible. The distance still to be
traversed is about ten miles. The Flight into Egypt is one of the first
events in the life of Christ which marked the power of the Prince of this
world, whom Jesus Christ had come to combat and to conquer, by
innocence and suffering.</p>

<p>In Bethlehem the Holy Family, as is still the custom, had lain down
soon after dusk, and doubtless the intimation by dream was given while
the protection of night still offered the longest opportunity of escape.
It was a voice ringing out its warning after the dreamer had started up
in the darkness, “Arise, and take the young child and his mother and flee
into Egypt.” The Rabbinical writers speak of the time anterior to the
day of the expected Messiah as destitute of marvels and miracles, these
having ceased since the death of Simon the Just—a period of nearly
two hundred years—and about this date an age of spiritual activity is
witnessed to by them. Wonders in the heavens and on the earth occur,
although not of the stupendous kind that had been expected, and which
later the Doctors demanded of Christ. Dreams of Divine inspiration are
mentioned out of the Gospels as frequently affecting the fate of men.
St. Joseph had a spirit of profound obedience to heavenly authority.
The Founder of Islamism declared that among all the ancient prophets
none was greater than Jonah. To me it seems that among the saints in
the group which fostered the Christian Church during its first perils, none<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8"></a>[8]</span>
was greater than Joseph, and this for an opposite reason. He had the
very soul of submission and faith, bearing all evil report and contumely
without resentment when once he had been assured that the Heavenly
Father’s purpose needed this. It seems to us no confession of weakness
in this claim for the first of the Fathers of Christianity to state here that
St. Joseph was last of all the band of guardians of the infant Church,
recognised in its established days as a saint. It is a further proof of his
humility, and of that true trust in right doing which leaves all after-issues
to God, when his command sanctifies a course. “Pray that your flight
be not on the Sabbath, nor in the winter,” may have been said with some
family memory of the troubles suffered on the escape from Herod’s
cunning. In April short storms of severity occur; the writer has seen
on the eighth day of this month snow three inches deep which had fallen
during the night. The picture gives snow on the heights, and to be
consistent the beginning of their journey would have been under a cloud-covered
sky. Dark and forbidding would have been the scene as the
travellers emerged from the town (walled, in part at least, since remains
of such are still traceable near the tomb of the mother of Benoni) the
wind blustering through the exposed valleys and scouring over the heights,
the anger of heaven and earth alike dictating stealth and silencing all
converse.</p>

<p>In succeeding generations fancy decorated the story with many
legends, but although these are often innocent, and even poetic beyond
the ordinary mark of the apocryphal Gospel narratives, they are all
avoided in this conception. Here no legend is taken for authority. The
attempt is to put together the detached links of the story, and I rely only
upon my personal knowledge of the country and climate, acquired by
many years of residence throughout all its seasons, to understand how the
sorrows of that night would be intensified by the angry elements.</p>

<p>The looking back upon a home from which a family is driven by
oppression has ever been regarded as a motive for compassion, and to this
calamity the Holy Family had to submit. The heights to the south of
“Beit Jala”—by some writers recognised as Rama—give an extended
view, the mountains of Moab far away to the east, and the Dead Sea
below, the great plain of Philistia down in the west. A storm thence
seen produces the impression of sublime purpose. The lightning gathers
beyond the great hollow which includes Jericho and the lost Sodom and
Gomorrah, and then wavers, as the fingers of a mighty player upon the
keys of a musical instrument, collecting the errant forces of the air, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9"></a>[9]</span>
tremulous with dancing flame in the south over the extending table-land
it seems to linger as though searching the plain of Philistia for its special
mark, and there darts down in fury; but the sword which was to pierce
the breast of the mother, “blessed withal above all women,” was of man’s
forging. According to our order of events the noisy elements would not
have endured long, for soon the peaceful snow followed falling with its
wandering flakes. It would be then that the cry would sound, which
St. Matthew quotes Jeremiah to describe, “In Rama was there a voice
heard, lamentation, and weeping and great mourning, Rachel weeping for
her children, and would not be comforted because they are not.” We
are not debarred from thinking that the mother suffered some of her pain
in the wonder natural to humanity, that the powers of evil should be able
thus to prevail over the pure and the righteous.</p>

<p>It is natural to follow the mind of the mother in such distraction of
love, while the wintry mountains are traversed, and the fugitives descend
into the rich plain with its genial breath, the more placid from the cleared
sky. We can understand the comfort that would be prayed for—a higher
Knowledge of the Divine mercy—and we can conceive how this came to
her through her pure maternal charity, in the form of ever increasing
tender regard for the woes of the children torn from their mothers’ breasts
for ever, and of the bereaved childless women mourning their dearest ones.
She searches her much harassed mind to find consolation for the weeping
neighbours of her home. The party pass through the rich corn-fields,
among villages of peaceful slumberers. The whole air is balmy and
soothing. They feel the comfort of peace after a storm. The torrents
would no longer be in broken cascades but flowing along in deep channels
to the sea, the further from the uplands the greater the change in the
temperature. Recently the travellers have made a turn in their course
to find a crossing sure to be provided in Roman days over the deep river
which has to be crossed in the path to a village on the road. The
garments which the Mother is about to arrange have been carried with
other needful gear in the saddle-bags. Her own under-garment is the
wedding-dress of Bethlehem, worn by a bride until it is past service.
While her Child is being re-dressed, and is thus engaging her solicitude,
He calls her attention to the holy company around them. The spirits of
the children of Bethlehem troop along by the side, they bear the signs of
their martyrdom. Garlanded as were ancient sacrifices and bearing
branches of blossoming trees; like enrolled saints they appear “in habit”
as they lived, the forward ones already rejoice in the knowledge of their<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10"></a>[10]</span>
high service. Midway there is an infant bewildered to find that his new
spiritual body bears no trace of the fatal wound. Behind in the air are
babes; this sleeping, grieving group is the only one in the picture which
in its sorrowing aspect connects the idea of human pain with the fate
suffered, for the rest, in degrees differing, death is already seen to have
no sting, the grave no victory.</p>

<p>The foal accompanies the mother ass, in a long journey the young
creature lags behind whinnying in remonstrance at the ceaseless steps, and
only hurrying on in bounds when there is fear of the parent ass getting
beyond reach and sight. The glorified infants are encircling the weary
laggard, who is thus brought up to the onward group. The wild dogs
which have come out of the mill-house to bark—as is their wont with
nocturnal travellers striving to pass a homestead in silence—are cowed at
the unusual apparition and steal away in fear. The leader and father of
the party, St. Joseph, regards not the ghostly attendants. He is engaged
in securing the best means of safety while passing the near village. He
watches the distant fires to discover any signs there might be of pursuit.
He is passing over the shallow stream supplied for irrigation by the
creaking water-wheel. The liquid surface is</p>

<p class="noic">“Pavid with the image of the sky,”</p>

<p class="noi">and burdened lightly with the fallen flower from the hand of one of the
foremost seraphic children. In contrast to this mundane reflection of
Heaven—which takes the leader’s steps for the moment—are the waves
on which the children dance along. They are not clouds such as angels
may be portrayed upon. They are from the fountain of the water of
life, given to them that are athirst freely (athirst for fuller life). It is
the spiritual eternal stream provided in exchange for the life that
perisheth which has been to them so brief. These first Christian
martyrs no longer walk on the earth, but they travel on the living
waters of life, bringing comfort to their late fellows and to all future
disciples who have yet their burdens to bear and their victory to
win. “How beautiful upon the mountains are the feet of him that
bringeth good tidings, that publisheth peace; that bringeth good tidings
of good, that publisheth salvation; that saith unto Zion, Thy God
reigneth.”</p>

<p>The stream is portrayed as ever rolling onward and breaking—where
it might if real water be dissipated in vapour—into magnified
globes which image the thoughts rife in that age in the minds of pious<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11"></a>[11]</span>
Jews, particularly of those in great tribulation, of the millennium which
was to be the mature outcome of the advent of the Messiah. The
promises to the Patriarchs are progressive as is all the teaching of
Revelation. The dream at Bethel first clearly speaks of the union of
Earth and Heaven. This was the dawn of the exaltation of the Jewish
faith, and accordingly the large orb reflects dimly the Patriarch asleep
with a twofold ladder or pathway up and down, which is traversed by the
servants of God. The intention is to combine with the first beautiful
dream of the Patriarch other ideas of Messiah’s reign which harmonise
with this, and which were developed later. Heaven is indicated by the
adoration by the elders of the spotless Lamb, and the brokenheartedness
of those who turn towards Heaven is illustrated by the fallen penitent, by
the burden-bearing of the faithful pilgrim, and the leading of the lion by
the young child, while the tree of life in the midst bears the fruit for the
healing of the nations.</p>

<p>So far it has been recognised that for the guidance of spectators who
have no unlimited time to work out for themselves the intention of the
picture, an explanation of my purpose was necessary. I however remember
with gratification that when the picture was yet incomplete, the main
intention of the design was apprehended by some of the few visitors to
my studio, and that Professor Ruskin on seeing it, while the principal
group was then only crudely expressed, in the impulse of generous
appreciation, alluded to the purpose of the children in the picture in
words of such correctness as well as exquisite expression and measure
that, had they described the complete design, the painter might well
have dreaded to provide any other. Shortly afterwards I had to abandon
the first painting from defects in the canvas on which it was painted,
after excessive loss of time and repeated disappointments which then
nearly disposed me to give up the subject and turn to some other.
Without the spontaneous appreciation of our great writer on art, to
whose championship in the early days of preraphaelitism I owe so much,
I should scarcely have persevered to save the work of so many alternating
feelings of joy and pain. The Art Professor now kindly permits me to
quote from his <cite>Lectures on the Art of England</cite>:</p>

<p>“For all human loss and pain, there is no comfort, no interpretation
worth a thought, except only in the doctrine of the Resurrection; of
which doctrine, remember, it is an immutable historical fact that all the
beautiful work, and all the happy existence of mankind, hitherto, has
depended on, or consisted in, the hope of it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12"></a>[12]</span></p>

<p>“The picture of which I came to-day chiefly to speak, as a symbol
of that doctrine, was incomplete when I saw it, and is so still; but enough
was done to constitute it the most important work of Hunt’s life, as yet;
and if health is granted to him for its completion, it will, both in reality
and in esteem, be the greatest religious painting of our time.</p>

<p>“You know that in the most beautiful former conceptions of the
Flight into Egypt, the Holy Family were always represented as watched
over, and ministered to, by attendant angels. But only the safety and
peace of the Divine Child and its mother are thought of. No sadness or
wonder of meditation returns to the desolate homes of Bethlehem.</p>

<p>“But in this English picture all the story of the escape, as of the
flight, is told, in fulness of peace, and yet of compassion. The travel is in
the dead of the night, the way unseen and unknown;—but, partly stooping
from the starlight, and partly floating on the desert mirage, move,
with the Holy Family, the glorified souls of the Innocents. Clear in
celestial light, and gathered into child-garlands of gladness, they look to
the Child in whom they live, and yet, for them to die. Waters of the
River of Life flow before on the sands: the Christ stretches out His arms
to the nearest of them;—leaning from His mother’s breast.</p>

<p>“To how many bereaved households may not this happy vision of
conquered death bring in the future, days of peace.</p>

<p>“I do not care to speak of other virtues in this design than those
of its majestic thought,—but you may well imagine for yourselves how
the painter’s quite separate and, in its skill, better than magical, power of
giving effects of intense light, has aided the effort of his imagination,
while the passion of his subject has developed in him a swift grace of
invention which for my own part I never recognised in his design till
now. I can say with deliberation that none even of the most animated
groups and processions of children which constitute the loveliest sculpture
of the Robbias and Donatello, can more than rival the freedom and
felicity of motion, or the subtlety of harmonious line, in the happy wreath
of these angel-children.</p>

<p>“Of this picture I came to-day chiefly to speak, nor will I disturb
the poor impression which my words can give you of it by any immediate
reference to other pictures by our leading masters.”</p>

<p>A brief explanation of the history of the production of this picture
is called for both as an apology for the long interval since last I exhibited
a large picture, and also of the fact that the painting now shown is
a repetition of my first attempt to illustrate this imaginative episode in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13"></a>[13]</span>
“The Flight into Egypt,” which before long, will also be exhibited, cured
of its defect. I may be allowed, perhaps, to state that first in the year
1854, I acted upon a resolution formed earlier to go to Palestine. This
was to revivify on canvas, if it were possible to me, the facts of Scripture
History, by study not made in sketches to be incorporated in subject
pictures afterwards in England. My aim was rather to advance nearer
to the truth than had yet been done, by patiently working out a whole
picture, surrounded by the very people and the circumstances of the
life in Judea of old days. To strive—while not forgetting the vital
ambition of an artist, which is to serve as high priest and expounder of
the excellence of the works of the Creator—choosing the highest types
and combinations of His handiworks, as the Greeks taught the after-world
to do, so that men’s admiration may be fascinated by the perfections
of the works of the Great Author of all, and men’s life thus may be a
continual joy and solace, and at the same time to embody the events by
which God in His providence led the foremost of the people Israel to be
prepared to act as teachers and prophets to the whole Gentile world. I
did not—let me say—wish to condemn any artistic manly treatment of
similar subjects by others. My idea suggested the experiment to me as
worth making for myself. The attempt was beset with difficulties beyond
expectation, and being away for long, put me at many disadvantages in
my profession, but I have many reasons for rejoicing at the course taken,
and I have now to gratefully acknowledge the recognition of the public
who, from the time of the exhibition of the first result of my Eastern
labours—“The Scapegoat,” have ever given exceptional attention to my
paintings, produced only, I regret to say, at long intervals, owing to
circumstances external to the limits of this statement.</p>

<p>In 1875 I returned to Jerusalem after an absence of two years.
I had taken the care usual with experienced travellers to have all my
luggage studiously packed and directed before leaving England. It was,
however, an omission of mine, which seemed a trivial one at the time, not
to see them delivered into the hands of the agent for the carriers to Jaffa.
On my arrival in Syria the cases containing all my precious materials
for my work had not arrived. Every effort possible was made to obtain
information of my missing boxes, and I delayed for months to commence
my picture. The excitement during this period, fanned by fanatical
Moslems, grew very fierce. The miseries caused by the conscription for
the Russian war, and still more those caused by the rapacity of governors
who found the opportunity a good one for increasing their dishonest<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14"></a>[14]</span>
exactions, drove the poor fellaheen well nigh mad with ferocity, and it
was easy then, as it was in Alexandria, and as it will ever be under
similar circumstances, to make the poor people believe that all such
miseries are sent by Heaven as a curse on them for not extirpating the
enemies of Islamism. We lived always in doubt as to what a day might
bring forth. Had the people been less dangerous I would have left my
family for two weeks or so, and purchased canvas in Naples or Rome.
As it was I dared not leave them. When first the uncertainty about my
materials seemed serious and altogether inscrutable, I felt forced to
purchase the best piece of linen to be found in Jerusalem. This I
prepared with the tempera ground, which before had proved to be
perfect. When this was ready, however, I still lingered over my
preliminary work, in hope that the proper canvas would arrive; but
months further went by mocking my hopes, and eventually I had to
undertake my deferred labours upon the sheeting which the fortune of
the day had compelled me to choose.</p>

<p>It was a chapter of accidents bearing pain and long long trial to me.
The earliest part of my work was the sketching in of the whole composition
and the painting of the background. No test of the suitability of
my surface could have been more satisfactory as far as was needed for the
point reached. I almost dismissed anxiety about the final results, and I
had advanced considerably with my work before the missing boxes arrived.
It seemed a great and needless waste to recommence my labours when so
much apparently had been done. It would have been well for me,
however, had I thrown all my work aside, and begun again, and
this indeed it would have been even years later, for from the moment
when I suspected with what fatal consequences my first start had been
beset, until the moment, when in England, at the end of 1882, I gave up
the picture, I always had reason to persuade myself that a little more
patience—perhaps even the perseverance further of two more weeks—might
overcome the difficulty intervening between the stage arrived at
and the entire completion of the picture. I will not weary the reader
with a statement of all the vexatious incidents of my trouble, but it is
only a needful excuse for me to state that a studio built specially for me
by German instead of Arab builders, let in the rain as though the roof
had been made of open wire, and that when this worry had passed, I was
under summons to come back to London by a certain date, and this made
the difficulty greater of deliberately estimating the amount of danger
which I incurred in advancing my work on the imperfect surface.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15"></a>[15]</span></p>

<p>When I opened the picture in London and placed it in a fair light
I could not fail to see how much precious time had been wasted from the
fact that all my drawing and modelling and colour indeed was marred by
irregularity of the plane on which they were given. I called in an expert
to help me in the course to be followed, and he, as it happened, urged me
still to trust to the means already used to overcome the evil, expressing
the opinion that it was then nearly at an end. Alas! this proved to be
far from the case, although I called in the best judgment to guide me at
intervals, and I confided the work for relining on the strongest sailcloth
canvas to the hands of one of the most skilful of restorers. Every revived
hope ended in disappointment, until I having persevered with it for seven
years and a half, finally abandoned it, and commenced on the new painting
on January 1st, 1883. Since then, when away for my health, the reliner
again had the old picture to treat on a plan of a radical character agreed
upon between us. It was to cut out the central part of the sheeting
containing the group of the Virgin and Child, to lift up the surrounding
cloth, to fray out its edges, to insert a piece larger by an inch than the
opening, with margins also frayed in the opposite direction, and to place
the whole already relined picture upon another sailcloth. Unlimited
time was given for this experiment, and I am happy to say that now the
picture is thoroughly sound, and that it will soon be ready. The present
exhibited painting is about four inches broader and two inches higher
than the Jerusalem picture: it is also changed in several points, some of
which modifications I have since adopted as improvement for the old
picture: other additions, however, are only in the present painting.</p>
